# Idea
A professional learning community (PLC) is an opportunity for a group of colleagues within a specific field to  participate in collaborative learning. EduNova is an online PLC platform where teachers can engage one another in developing a more consistent curriculum without the barriers of distance or location. Here, they can help enhance curriculum, share visions, contribute and encourage each other with the ultimate purpose of improving education.
